<h1> Salary Expensis </h1>

the idea is to make an app that takes the salary from the user then the user can split his <b>salary</b>
into the categories of his choice like family, bills, university etc.. ,
the app will give the user the ability to choose how much to spend on each category as long it does not be more than his <b>salary</b>,
the idea for the app is fairly simple but until know, I don't know how to do it I will try my best...
